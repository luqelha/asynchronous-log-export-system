# 🚀 Asynchronous Log Export System

**A scalable asynchronous log export system built with Node.js, RabbitMQ, Redis, and Docker.**

The system is designed to handle thousands of log files efficiently by offloading heavy compression tasks to background workers using a message queue architecture.

# 📖 Project Overview

Traditional log export systems usually process file compression directly inside the main application server. This approach increases response time significantly and limits scalability when handling thousands of files simultaneously.

This project adopts an **asynchronous architecture** by separating responsibilities into several independent services:

- **API Gateway** handles incoming requests.
- **RabbitMQ** queues export jobs.
- **Worker Service** processes compression tasks.
- **Redis** stores real-time job status.
- **Storage** stores raw logs and generated ZIP files.

The API returns a **Job ID immediately**, allowing users to monitor progress without waiting for the compression process to finish.

# 🏗 System Architecture

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/architecture.png" width="900">
</p>

### Architecture Components

### API Gateway

- Receive client request
- Validate request
- Generate Job ID
- Store initial status in Redis
- Publish job to RabbitMQ
- Return response immediately

### RabbitMQ

Acts as a queue between the API Gateway and Worker Service.

### Worker Service

- Listen to RabbitMQ
- Read thousands of log files
- Compress into ZIP
- Store ZIP file
- Update Redis status

### Redis

Stores job status:

- Pending
- Processing
- Completed
- Failed

# 🐇 RabbitMQ Flow

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/rabbitmq.png" width="850">
</p>

The API Gateway publishes export jobs into the `export_logs` queue. Worker Service continuously consumes messages from the queue and processes them asynchronously.

---

# 📦 Redis Flow

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/rediscli.png" width="850">
</p>

Redis stores each Job ID as a key, allowing clients to retrieve job progress efficiently without querying a relational database.

# 📈 Performance Testing

Performance testing was conducted using **Apache JMeter** with multiple concurrent user scenarios.

| Scenario           | Requests | Avg Response (ms) | Max Response (ms) | Throughput (req/s) | Error Rate | Result  |
| ------------------ | -------: | ----------------: | ----------------: | -----------------: | ---------: | ------- |
| Test 1 (10 Users)  |       10 |                19 |                83 |               2.22 |      0.00% | ✅ Pass |
| Test 2 (25 Users)  |       25 |                 6 |                 9 |               5.20 |      0.00% | ✅ Pass |
| Test 3 (50 Users)  |       50 |                16 |               131 |              10.32 |      0.00% | ✅ Pass |
| Test 4 (100 Users) |      100 |                 9 |                89 |              20.18 |      0.00% | ✅ Pass |
| Test 5 (200 Users) |      200 |                 9 |                85 |              40.13 |      0.00% | ✅ Pass |

### Summary

- Response time remained well below **1 second**.
- Error rate remained **0%** across all test scenarios.
- Throughput increased proportionally with the number of concurrent requests.
- API Gateway remained responsive because compression tasks were delegated to Worker Service via RabbitMQ.
